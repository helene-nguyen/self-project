# ABOUT THIS WEB PAGE

## Introduction

Why I've made this webpage ? 

We are now February 2022, I started my journey to be a web developper.
For the challenge, I've made this webpage for training and helping (myself and anybody that come).

I really enjoyed to build that on my own with the skills I've learnt.

I'm really thankful of [O'clock](https://oclock.io/) school for having so much nice and cute people always available.
